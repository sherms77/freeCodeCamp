// was thinking about using the .replace() method to dynamically update the regex to match patterns based on the array elements
// this may not work as you might need to use each element as a pattern to check the other one?
// let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
// let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");

// let text = "Mr Blue has a blue house and a blue car";
// let result = text.replace(/blue/g, "red");

// .replace()

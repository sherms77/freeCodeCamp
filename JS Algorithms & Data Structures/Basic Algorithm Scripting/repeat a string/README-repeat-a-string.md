# fcc challenge
- [repeat a string repeat a string](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string)

# challenge
Repeat a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. For the purpose of this challenge, do not use the built-in .repeat() method.

# rules
1. if `num` is not a positive number, return an **empty** string.
2. do not use `.repeat()` method.

# conditions
1. test if `str` is an integer -> if **NO** return `str`
2. test if `num` is a **POSITITVE** number -> if no return `""`

# challenge code
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  return str;
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3);

# Hints
Hint 1
The program is very simple, we have to take a variable and return that variable being repeated certain amount of times. No need to add space or anything, just keep repeating it into one single string.

Hint 2
You canâ€™t edit strings, you will need to create a variable to store the new string.

Hint 3
Create a loop to repeat the code as many times as needed.

Hint 4
Make the variable created store the current value and append the word to it.

# notes
- 201222: solved -> refer to `repeat-string.js` for final solution.
- 171222: still trying to get the condition correct. refer to `loop-function-test.js`. isolated for loop to analyse. used `js visualiser` to debug.
- 161222: i increased the number in the argument from `3` to `4` and i got the same output -> string only repeated `twice`. I am not `appending` the string correctly. **next step**: 1. work out how to append the string correctly to get the string to `repeat` the correct number of times.
- 161222: analysing my `for loop` conditions. established that `i++` and `i+=1` are the `same` -> refer to link `6` in `resources` section. there is a problem with my `initaliser` and `i < num` condition. it does `not` repeat the string the correct amount of times.
- 161222: removed condition `var checkNum = Number.isInteger(str);` which did not affect the output. I didn't implement that condition anywhere so it didn't stop the function from outputting `non-integers`. 
- 161222: reviewed hints. it appears I have followed the hints. unsure why my code does not pass all tests.
- 161222: i get the correct output but I also get an `undefined` error. ther code does not work in the fcc editor. it fails tests `1-5`.
- 131222: code still does not pass all tests in challenge. refer to screenshot. got it to work correctly in `for_loop.js`. **next step**: 1.debug code in `repeat.string.js`.
- 121222: experimenting with link `5` in `resources` section. unable to get it to work correctly. refer to `for_loop.js`.
- 111222: got conditions to work but need to print output in a `horizontal` format. **next step**: 1.read resources to try and work out. `loop_outputs.js` shows how to print in a table format using `nested for loops`.
- 101222: tested code in fcc editor. tried a return statement and a console.log statement. did not work. problem is with conditions. `repeat-string.js` has some incorrect outputs. refer to lines `21 and 25` in file for more info. I think I need to flatten the output too so it's not printed in a `horizontal` format not a `vertical` one.
- 251122: refer to `repeat-string.js`. code does not work. does not multiply `str` by `num`. will also need to remove condition 1 as outputting `*` is acceptable.
- 241122: tested for loop. refer to `for_loop.js`.

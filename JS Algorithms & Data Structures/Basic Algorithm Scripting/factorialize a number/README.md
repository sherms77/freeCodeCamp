# notes
- 230622: solved challenge with hints. refer to `factorialize-a-number.txt` for final solution. used recursion.
- 230622: decided to look at the hint.
- 200622: still trying to work out formula to factorialize number.
- 170622: still trying work out how to increment numbers so that it takes the product of the preceding numbers and multiplies it by the next number in the sequence. Eg: 1 * 2 = 2, 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 4 = 24, etc.
- 170622: trying to work out how to increment each number so that it multiplies its preceding number.

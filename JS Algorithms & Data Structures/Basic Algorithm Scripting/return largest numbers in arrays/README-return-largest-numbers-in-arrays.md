- [return largest numbers in arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/return-largest-numbers-in-arrays)

# challenge
Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].

# steps
1. iterate through each sub-array - DONE
2. find the largest number from each sub-array
3. save the largest number from each sub-array into a new array
4. return the `new` array with the largest numbers

# challenge code
function largestOfFour(arr) {
  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);

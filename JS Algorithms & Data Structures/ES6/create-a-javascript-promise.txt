// JS Promise - makes promise to do something, usually asynchrously.
// When the task completes, you either keep the promise or fail to do so.
// Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the 'new' keyword to create one.
// It takes a function as it's argument, with two paramaters - resolve and reject.
// These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise.

// Syntax:

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  
});

[] is used to create character class.
Character classes let you define a group of characters you want to match by putting them inside square brackets ([ and ]).
The regex character class below matches all characters with 'aeiou' multiple times, ignoring case.
The 'g' and 'i' flags are used to: 
 - match multiple expressions, and 
 - ignore case 
 (respectively) in addition to the character class of [aeiou].

// ? character is used for lazy matching.
// Eg: /t[a-z]*i/ returns ["titani"].
// The above is a greedy match which is the default for regular expressions.
// It finds all letters in between t and i.
// But /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"] which is a lazy match.
// A lazy match stops when it meets the match minimum.
// Regex below finds any one character (. - wildcard character) between < >.
// * character matches characters that occurs zero or more times.
// ? character returns a lazy match.
let myRegex = /<.*?>/; // Change this line
let result = text.match(myRegex);

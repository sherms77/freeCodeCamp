// Setup
const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// watched video to work out

// Only change code below this line
var total = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
  total += myArr[i]; // total adds to each value in index of myArr. 
  		     // Eg: total is 0 initially and will be added to 2.
  		     // total will become 2 then will be added to 3 which will = 5, etc.
} 

console.log(total); // not in challenge code but this will output total.

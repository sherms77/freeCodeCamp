- Solutions to code challenges from this course are saved here.
- Only saved code from challenges for reference purposes.
- I did not save solutions here if I was: 
	- able to solve the challenge in the fcc editor, and 
	- did not need any further analysis or understanding of the problem/lesson.
- The JS Algorithms & Data Structures became **legacy** in Dec 2023. [Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-with-new-data-structures-and-algorithms-certification-projects/).
